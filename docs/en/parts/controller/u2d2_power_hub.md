# [Cautions](#cautions)

1. When using the terminal block, the left-side is ground and right-side is source, so be careful of polarity when using an external power supply.
2. Since the back of the board is exposed to several pins, it is recommended to combine the provided supporters so that the conductor does not touch the floor to some extent.
